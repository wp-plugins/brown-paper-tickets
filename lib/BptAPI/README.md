# Brown Paper Tickets PHP API
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/brownpapertickets/BptAPI.php.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/brownpapertickets/BptAPI.php) [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/brown-paper-tickets/bpt-api.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/brown-paper-tickets/bpt-api) [![License MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

The BptAPI library consists of a set of classes that enable you to easily interact with the [Brown Paper Tickets API](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/apidocs/index.html).

Since this library is still in early development, method names will possibly change.
See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on any breaking changes.

## Install
Via Composer:
`$ composer require brown-paper-tickets/bpt-api`

## Usage

You'll want to first initialize the class that contains the methods you want to use. The class names mirror the [official API documentation](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/apidocs/index.html). 

So if you were looking to get info on an event's sales, you'd use the `SalesInfo` class. Please note, the methods names are completely different (and hopefully easier to make use of). Every time you intialize a class, you need to pass in your Brown Paper Tickets Developer ID.

For Example, to get a listing of events under a specific account, you'd use the [EventInfo](#eventinfo) class.

```php
$eventInfo = new EventInfo('Your Developer ID');
```

That will give you access to all of that class' methods.

To obtain an array containing all of the producer's events, we'd invoke the `getEvents` method. The get events method takes a total of four arguments:

| Arguments | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `$username` | String  | No | The event producer whos events you wish to info on. |
| `$eventID`  | Integer | No | If you only want info on a single event, you can pass in it's ID. |
| `$getDates` | Boolean | No | Pass `true` if you want to get a list of dates belonging to the event. Defaults to `false`|
| `$getPrices`| Boolean | No | Pass `true` if you want to get a list of prices belogning to each Date. Defaults to `false`|

```php
$events = $eventInfo->getEvents('some user name' null, true, true);
 ```
This would return an associative array with all of the event info along with dates and prices:

```php

        [fullDescription] => This is the full description. Much fuller! Lots more to say! OMG!

Use the Full Description to describe your event as completely as possible. It's common to list performers or presenters along with a short bio for each. Additional details, such as a description of the expected activities, help create interest for potential attendees and can greatly increase attendance. This is your chance to create a verbal picture of your event!

### ManageCart

Some methods will return a results array with two fields. The first is `success` which is a bolean indicating whether or not it failed and a `message` field explaining why.

#### initCart($cartID = null, $createdAt = null)
Starts a new cart session with Brown Paper Tickets. You can also pass in an existing `cartID` and the time it was `createdAt`. If the cart has expired it will return a results array with `success` set to `false`.

If successful, it will return a results array with `success` set to `true` as well as a `cartID` and `cartCreatedAt` field.

__Returns__
The newly created `cartID`. This cart will expire after 15 minutes.


#### isExpired()
Determines whether or not the `cartID` has expired.

#### getCartId()

__Returns__
The `cartID`.


#### setAffiliateID($affiliateID)

Pass your affiliate ID if you want to earn a commission on the sale.

#### setPrices($prices)
Set the prices to send to the cart. Will return the set prices.
This does not update the actual cart (use `sendPrices()` for that).

This will throw out any prices with an invalid shipping method and will determine
whether or not will call names need to be required when adding shipping info.

Pass in an array of prices IDs. Each Price ID value should be set to an array
with the following fields:

| parameter | type | description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `shippingMethod` | integer | An integer representing shipping method*
| `quantity` | integer | the number of tickets you wish to add. |
| `affiliateID` | integer | Optional. If you wish to earn a commision, add the affiliate ID. |

*Shipping Methods 1 for Physical, 2 for Will Call, 3 for Print at Home.

```php
$prices = array(
    '12345' => array(
        'shippingMethod' => 1,
        'quantity' => 2,
    ),
    '12346' => array(
        'shippingMethod' => 3,
        'quantity' => 3
    )
);
```

Returns an array of the set prices.

#### removePrices($prices)
Pass in an array of price IDs and it will remove the price IDs passed from the set prices. This does not update the actual cart (use `sendPrices()` for that).

__Returns__
An array of the set prices.

#### sendPrices()
Send the prices to the cart via the API.

Returns the results array.

#### getPrices()
Returns the prices set.

#### getValue()
Returns the current value of the cart as it was set when adding prices.
Note: When the class sets the value, it will determine whether or not certain fields are required for the billing info. See `setShipping()` for more info.

#### setShipping($shipping)
Pass in an array of shipping information.

| field | notes |
|-------|-------|
| firstName | |
| lastName | |
| address | |
| address2 | |
| city | |
| state | |
| zip | |
| country | Values include "United States" and "Canada". |

If you have selected tickets that require Will Call names, you can pass in a different name using the `willCallFirstName` and `willCallLastName` fields. Otherwise it will default to using the first and last name fields for will call names.

#### setBilling($billing)
Pass in an array of billing information.

Always pass these fields:

| field | notes |
|-------|-------|
| firstName | |
| lastName | |

When the cart's value is greather than 0, you must also include the following fields. If you do not, then the cart will return the results array with the message ""

| field | notes |
|-------|-------|
| address | |
| address2 | |
| city | |
| state | |
| zip | |
| email | |
| phone | |
| country | Values include "United States" and "Canada". |
| type | Credit card type. Must be "Visa", "Mastercard", "Discover" or "Amex" |
| number | Credit card number. Must be a string |
| expMonth | Expiration month. |
| expYear | Expriration year. |
| cvv2 | Credit card verification code |

Returns a results array.

#### sendBilling()
Sends the billing information to the cart.

Once this has been called and is successful, you will no longer be able to `sendPrices()`, `sendShipping()` or `sendBilling()`. 

Returns a results array with the following fields:

| field | notes |
|-------|-------|
| success | boolean |
| message | A description of the results |
| ticketUrl | If successful and this shipping method was chosen, a link to the print-at-home tickets |
| cartID | the ID of the cart ID |
| receiptURL | If successful, a URL to the order's receipt on BPT. | 

#### getReceipt()
Returns the results received by the `sendBilling()` method.
